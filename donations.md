One of the most basic and popular models for sustaining an open-source project is through simple user donations. While the donation model is popular, it is very difficult to sustain a reasonable level of income solely from donations as a small project developer. In many cases, open-source projects fall victim to the tragedy of the commons. Essentially users of the open-source project act in their short-term self-interest which is to use the project for free and not contribute or donate to the project. The issue arises when most users engage in this type of behavior. Over time the project maintainer is incentivized to abandon the project due to economic reasons. (1)

Large foundations such as Wikimedia or the Apache Software Foundation can sustain projects on donations because of their scale and reach. In fiscal year 2019, the Wikimedia foundation brought in $110,972,163 from donations and contributions, enough to sustain the foundationâ€™s projects (2). 

Similarly, the Apache Software Foundation receives considerable donations, but in fiscal year 2020 quarter 3 the Apache Software Foundation brought in over 10x more money with sponsorships than donations (3). While donations continue to be an important revenue stream, sponsorships are quickly emerging as the dominant stream for Apache.

In general, it seems important to have donations as a revenue stream, but not the only or primary way of funding a project. In most cases, the project will not be able to fund development purely off donations. While there are exceptions and successful projects that run off donations, for every one successful project there are countless failures. Donations combined with other methods such as sponsorships, branded merchandise, or license exceptions could be a successful combination.
