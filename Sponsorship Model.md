Vue.js and Sponsorship Model
Vue.js is an open-source web framework for JavaScript. Vue.js was ranked as the 7th most popular web framework in the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey with 17.3% of the votes (3).

Vue.js creator Evan You has 160 patrons and more than $15,000 per month coming in on donations on Patreon. I am referring to this as the sponsorship model due to the recurring payments. The majority of the sponsorships seem to be coming from corporations.

Different levels of sponsorships on Patreon which range from $10 per month to $2,000 per month provide different levels of exposure to the sponsor. Ranging from the $10 per month tier getting the backerâ€™s name inside of the backers.MD file in the repository, to the $2,000/month tier getting the backer more exposure by putting their name and company logo on several high traffic pages. The key in the application of the sponsorship model for Vue.js is that the repository receives high traffic, You reports 500,000 unique visitors per month (2). It is important to point out that developers often refer to the Vue.js documentation when developing, so in addition to unique visitors, developers often consult the documentation (1).

You is essentially selling ads on his repository. You successfully leverages the popularity of Vue.js to sell advertising to companies at set prices per month. Advertising revenue is a significant portion of giant tech companies, You and Vue.js follow a similar model in principle.
