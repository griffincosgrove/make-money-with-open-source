Sponsorware is a very new model created by Caleb Porzio and Daniel Coulbourne. Porzio first used the model on one of his open-source projects on GitHub. The model takes advantage of the fairly recent addition of a program called GitHub Sponsors where other GitHub users can ‘sponsor’ or compensate other developers and maintainers through GitHub.

After the package or repository is created it is closed-source until a certain number of sponsors on GitHub is reached. After the number of sponsors is achieved, then the project is open-sourced and freely available. The number is fairly arbitrary but make sure it is attainable.

After the project is open-sourced the primary developer can seek additional revenue from providing other services for sponsors or higher-tiered sponsors. Porzio creates educational material in the form of screencasts (1). The screencasts provide enhanced documentation and tutorials on how to use the package optimally. Porzio reports his income jumped by over 100% by introducing educational content (1). 

More information on the Sponsorware model can be found in the documentation for the model found here: https://github.com/sponsorware/docs
